# Module2challenge
module challenge 2, my portfolio
I have created a portfolio with everything about myself!
I have connected my Github & LinkedIn profile with clockable links!
I have added a photo of myself and a photo of my first project from the bootcamp.
MY boxes on pages have a box shadow effect when hovering as well. The navigation bar has some effect as well. The background header is a gif with an infinite loop to draw in the user!
The footer also features a back to top button for ease on the user.
