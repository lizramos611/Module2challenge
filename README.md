Module 2 Challenge: MY Portfolio
<br>
I have created a portfolio with everything about myself! I have connected my Github & LinkedIn profile with clickable links! 
I have added a photo of myself and a photo of my first project from the bootcamp. My boxes on pages have a box shadow effect when hovering as well. 
The navigation bar has some effect as well. The background header is a gif with an infinite loop to draw in the user without a repeating effect.  
The footer also features a back to top button for ease on the user.
Comments have been added throughout the HTML & CSS file. 
Website loads with no error.
HTML & CSS passed the validator with no errors.
Website has a deployed live URL.
